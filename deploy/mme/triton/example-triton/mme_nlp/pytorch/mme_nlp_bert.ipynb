    "## How it works?\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker MME with GPU works with NVIDIA Triton server\n",
    "\n",
    "[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/) was developed specifically to enable scalable, cost-effective, and easy deployment of models in production. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is open-source inference serving software that simplifies the inference serving process and provides high inference performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of Triton are:\n",
    "* **Support for Multiple frameworks**: Triton can be used to deploy models from all major frameworks. Triton supports TensorFlow GraphDef, TensorFlow SavedModel, ONNX, PyTorch TorchScript, TensorRT, RAPIDS FIL for tree based models, and OpenVINO model formats. \n",
    "* **Model pipelines**: Triton model ensemble represents a pipeline of one or more models or pre/post processing logic and the connection of input and output tensors between them. A single inference request to an ensemble will trigger the execution of the entire pipeline.\n",
    "* **Concurrent model execution**: Multiple models (or multiple instances of the same model) can run simultaneously on the same GPU or on multiple GPUs for different model management needs.\n",
    "* **Dynamic batching**: For models that support batching, Triton has multiple built-in scheduling and batching algorithms that combine individual inference requests together to improve inference throughput. These scheduling and batching decisions are transparent to the client requesting inference.\n",
    "* **Diverse CPUs and GPUs**: The models can be executed on CPUs or GPUs for maximum flexibility and to support heterogeneous computing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use deploy multiple `bert-large-uncased` models to SageMaker multi model endpoint behind `g4dn.4xlarge` instance type"
