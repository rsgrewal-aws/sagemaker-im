    "# Amazon SageMaker Serverless using Linear Learner\n",
    "With [Amazon SageMaker Serverless ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html), which is a purpose-built inference option that makes it easy for you to deploy and scale ML models. Serverless Inference is ideal for workloads which have idle periods between traffic spurts and can tolerate cold starts. Serverless endpoints automatically launch compute resources and scale them in and out depending on traffic, eliminating the need to choose instance types or manage scaling policies. This takes away the undifferentiated heavy lifting of selecting and managing servers. Serverless Inference integrates with AWS Lambda to offer you high availability, built-in fault tolerance and automatic scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a pay-per-use model, Serverless Inference is a cost-effective option if you have an infrequent or unpredictable traffic pattern. During times when there are no requests, Serverless Inference scales your endpoint down to 0, helping you to minimize your costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can integrate Serverless Inference with your MLOps Pipelines to streamline your ML workflow, and you can use a serverless endpoint to host a model registered with Model Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases these capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate these capabilities, the notebook discusses the use case of predicting house prices in multiple cities using linear regression.  House prices are predicted based on features like number of bedrooms, number of garages, square footage etc.  Depending on the city, the features affect the house price differently.  For example, small changes in the square footage cause a drastic change in house prices in New York when compared to price changes in Houston.  For accurate house price predictions, we will train multiple linear regression models, a unique location specific model per city.  \n"
